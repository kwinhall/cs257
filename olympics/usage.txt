DESCRIPTION

    The options directly after the commands a, athlete, n, and noc are search criteria and search text.
    If the user chooses to specify search criteria (such as noc), they must also specify search text (such as USA).
    In the n or noc command, the user can sort by number of medals or alphabetical order of NOCs. 
    If there is search criteria and search text, the -s or --sort command must come after the search criteria and search text.
    The program sorts in ascending order by default.
    The user can sort in descending order after the specifying the sort option and sort category in the n or noc command.
    If the user inputs -h or --help, the program will print the usage statement.
      
    The following options are available:

    a | athlete         Prints a list of Olympic athletes. 
                        If search criteria and search text are not given, prints all Olympic athletes.
    n | noc             Prints a list of Olympic NOCs and the number of Olympic medals they have earned. 
                        If search criteria and search text are not given, prints all NOCs.
    -s | --sort         After the n or noc command, sorts data by the specified category. 
                        If not specified, sorts by medal. Data is sorted in ascending order by default.
    -d | --descending   After the -s or --sort command, sorts data in descending order. 
                        If absent, data is sorted in ascending order.
    -h | --help         Prints the usage statement.
